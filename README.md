## Overview

The **evals** repository provides essential tools for evaluating models against Elixir code. These tools help you understand what works effectively and what does not. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, this repository aims to streamline the evaluation process, making it easier for developers and researchers alike.

## Features

- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate various models against Elixir code with ease.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Get detailed reports on model performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands and options for quick access.
- **Open Source**: Free to use and modify under the MIT License.
- **Community Driven**: Contributions and feedback are welcome to improve the tools.

## Installation

To install the tools, you can clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tonyslebew/evals.git
```

After cloning, navigate into the directory:

```bash
cd evals
```

Next, install the required dependencies. If you are using Elixir, run:

```bash
mix deps.get
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start using the tools.

## Usage

To use the evaluation tools, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Models**: Ensure your models are compatible with Elixir.
2. **Run the Evaluation**: Use the command line to run the evaluation script.

For example, you can execute the evaluation with the following command:

```bash
mix eval --model your_model_name
```

This command will initiate the evaluation process and provide you with a detailed report.

For additional options and configurations, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.
